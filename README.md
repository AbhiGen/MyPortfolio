# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is a revamped version of my personal portfolio, built with a focus on modern UI/UX, interactivity, and responsiveness. It showcases my skills, projects, education, and coding stats.

## 🚀 Live Preview

To preview the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. For the best experience, it's recommended to serve the files using a local server. If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
